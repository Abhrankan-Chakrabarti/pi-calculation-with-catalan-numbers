# pi-calculation-with-catalan-numbers
This repository contains a Python script that calculates the digits of π (pi) using a novel algorithm based on Catalan numbers and fixed-point arithmetic. The algorithm efficiently computes the digits of π by leveraging the properties of Catalan numbers, making it a unique and effective method for high-precision calculations.
